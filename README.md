# Zepto Sales Data Analysis Project 🛒📊

This project provides an end-to-end data analysis of sales records from **Zepto**, a leading quick-commerce platform. Using Python and its core data science libraries, the project explores customer behavior, delivery efficiency, and product performance.

## 📌 Project Overview

The goal of this project is to transform raw transactional data into actionable business insights. By analyzing over 200,000 sales records, we identify key trends in delivery times, regional sales performance, and popular product categories.

## 📂 Repository Structure

* `zepto_project.ipynb`: The main Jupyter Notebook containing the Python code, analysis, and visualizations.
* `zepto_sales.csv`: Dataset containing transaction details (Order ID, Date, City, Delivery Status, etc.).
* `zepto_products.csv`: Metadata for products (Product ID, Name, Category, and Price).
* `README.md`: Project documentation.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

* **Language:** Python 3.x
* **Libraries:**
* **Pandas:** For data manipulation and cleaning.
* **NumPy:** For numerical operations and data transformation.
* **Matplotlib & Seaborn:** For creating statistical visualizations and identifying trends.



## 📊 Analysis Workflow

The analysis follows a structured data science pipeline:

1. **Data Ingestion:** Merging sales data with product catalogs to create a unified view.
2. **Data Cleaning:** Handling missing values in delivery times and removing duplicate records.
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
* Analyzing sales distribution across major cities (Mumbai, Delhi, Bangalore, etc.).
* Evaluating delivery performance by calculating average `delivery_time_mins`.




4. **Revenue Insights:** Identifying the highest-grossing product categories.
5. **Operational Metrics:** Analyzing the ratio of 'Delivered' vs. 'Cancelled' orders.

## 🚀 How to Run

1. **Clone the repository:**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/zepto-data-analysis.git

```


2. **Install dependencies:**
```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn

```


3. **Open the Notebook:**
Launch Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab and open `zepto_project.ipynb` to view the analysis.

## 📈 Key Insights

* **Operational Peak:** Most deliveries are completed within a 15-30 minute window.
* **Top Performers:** Specific cities show significantly higher order volumes for "Munchies" and "Dairy" categories.
* **Logistics:** Delivery cancellation rates correlate with specific peak-hour time slots.
